# LogNet

This is a Python library for building machine learning models for various problems that use LAS files.

## Installation
Clone the library as follows:
```
git clone git@tgs-github01.tgs.com:DataScience/LogNet.git
```
Install as follows:
```
python setup.py install
```
It is recommended to install the library in a separate environment and not at the global path.

## Development
`lognet` has git hooks enabled to ensure the code conforms to the standards described in GuideTools.

### Enabling `git` hooks
Provided the installation of `lognet` went smoothly, install `pre-commit` as follows:
```
pre-commit install
```
`pre-commit` should install to your `.git` directory. You only need to do this when you clone.
